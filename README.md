Predicting CAD Alignment on Indoor 3D Scans with Object Relation Prior (Research Track)

1. The model parameters are contained in checkpoint_().tar file. For example, the model with relation prior is saved at log_rp/checkpoint_rpcad.tar
2. Data preparation requires: ScanNet(http://www.scan-net.org/), ShapeNet(https://shapenet.org/), Scan2CAD(for annotation file)
3. A Full Annotation info. for CAD alignment is given in this repo., so you don't need to request it to authors
4. Use test file to reproduce the result in the paper
