Predicting CAD Alignment on Indoor 3D Scans with Object Relation Prior (Research Track)

1. The model parameters are contained in checkpoint_().tar file. For example, the model with relation prior is saved at log_rp/checkpoint_rpcad.tar
2. Data preparation requires: ScanNet(http://www.scan-net.org/), ShapeNet(https://shapenet.org/), Scan2CAD(for annotation file)
3. A Full Annotation info. for CAD alignment is given in this repo., so you don't need to request it to authors
